# Single Source of Truth
### Jon Gold at Airbnb proposed the concept of the Single Source of Truth system where definitions of all the pieces that make up a Design Language System (DLS) live. From there, many different applications can pull from that Single Source of Truth to ensure consistency across the user interfaces. In theory, the system is completely platform agnostic

## Constructing a Design Language System
### Set of rules for building a visual identity  to construct a consistent experience across all product mediums. This set of rules can define things like:

* Typography
* Colors
* Layouts
* User Interface components

# Universal Component Library
## Single Source of Truth containing Design Language System and Reusable React components

### Benefits
* Designer
  * `Prototype with real data. Ping your API and pass the results directly into your mockups. This lets you see what your app will really look like (no more lorem ipsum).`
  * `Prototype internationalization. Use Google translate to test how user interfaces look in other languages and output results side by side.`
  * `Keep assets in sync with actual deployed code.`
* Developers
  * `Less code to manage. If you can reuse code across platforms, you can save time, effort, and energy.`
  * `Code is all JavaScript. JavaScript powers the React side of all the applications, so engineers can seamlessly switch between working on the different platforms.`
* Business
  * `Do the math. If one engineer can now build for three platforms instead of one youâ€™re going to save a lot of money, and it takes less time to ship for multiple platforms.`
